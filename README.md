**reflection**
I found this excersise to be fairly difficult. Before attempting this homework I had a very elementary level understanding of how CSS and html coding works. I beleive I have become a little better at coding because of this excercise; however, there is much more to learn. The screenshot of the webpage below was taken before posting to github pages. I had to re organize file paths because of an error when opening the live site. The aligned box was longer but is now flush with the other main articles.
